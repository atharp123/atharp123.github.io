  <h1>Data Analysis Project</h1>

  <h2>Data Tools</h2>
  <p>
    In the Data Tools module, I feel like I gained an insight into data organization and experience in handling various data sets, 
    I have never used data sets and feel like after this module I picked up on some crucial skills in the world of data.
    I also learned various techniques for storing and managing data sets, including using spreadsheets and databases for efficient organization. 
    Furthermore, I feel like I acquired the ability to figure out essential info, such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, 
    which serve as foundational tools for understanding and interpreting data in excel. The module also focused on teaching pattern recognition in data sets,
    which allow me to identify trends, correlations, and anomalies that will help inform me in decision-making and problem-solving skills. 
    Overall, this module provided me with a strong foundation in data handling, 
    preparing myself to grasp knowledge on using excel in diverse fields for research that I may want to investigate further. 
  </p>

  <h2>Big Data</h2>
  <p>
    In the Big Data module, this module starts of by investigating the era of big data, its sources, and the challenges it presents,
    with a focus on digital libraries, scientific research, and medical records.
    I learned about the different approaches to storing and managing large volumes of data in these domains, such as cloud-based repositories,
    and advanced databases. They discovered how digital libraries leverage big data storage results to enhance information retrieval, searchability,
    and resource management. In scientific research, students explored how efficient data storage systems have enabled researchers to work with complex,
    large-scale data sets, leading to significant advancements in various fields. 
    The module also highlighted the impact of big data storage on medical records management, illustrating how it has revolutionized patient care,
    clinical decision-making, and the overall healthcare system. 
  </p>

  <h2>Biases in Machine Learning</h2>
  <p>
   In the Biases in Machine Learning module, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the impact of biases on various aspects of machine learning, 
    from algorithms to specific applications. I began by studying machine learning algorithms, learning how biases can be introduced during data collection, 
    preprocessing, and model training, leading to skewed or unfair outcomes. I then examined bias in predictive algorithms, 
    understanding how biased data can result in discriminatory decision-making across fields like finance, healthcare, and employment. 
    The module also explored the issue of bias in facial recognition technology, revealing how these systems may suspiciously mistake individuals based on factors such as race and gender.
    Lastly, I delved into bias in language translation, discussing how translation algorithms can enable stereotypes and cultural biases, accidentally promoting inequality. 
    By understanding the various sources and symptoms of bias in machine learning, I feel better equipped to develop ethical, fair, and unbiased AI systems in the future for my research ideas.
  </p>

  <h2>Unit Test</h2>
  <p>
   I successfully completed the final unit exam which covered the areas of Data Tools, Big Data, and Bias in Machine Learning, achieving a worthy score of 88%.
    From the Data Tools module, I developed skills in handling and organizing data sets, computing basic statistics, and identifying patterns in data. 
    These skills have provided me with a solid foundation in data alteration, appropriate across various industries. 
    The Big Data module expanded my knowledge of the era of big data, its sources, and challenges, particularly in areas like digital libraries, 
    scientific research, and medical records. I gained insights into efficient storage and management of large volumes of data,
    preparing me to contribute effectively to data-driven fields. In the Bias in Machine Learning module,
    I learned about the various sources and appearances of bias in machine learning algorithms and applications, such as predictive algorithms, facial recognition,
    and language translation. This understanding will enable me to develop more ethical, fair, and unbiased AI systems in my future endeavors. Overall, 
    the integrated skill of these modules has equipped me with the necessary knowledge and skills to excel in the rapidly evolving world of data and artificial intelligence.
    I enjoyed the modules and learning more about data and how we can use it overall.

  <h2>Final Project</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Choose a specific data set that you will use for this project</strong></li>
    <p>
      For my final project I wanted to see the correlation in users of the video streaming service Netflix, 
      I obtained the data set from using the provided Netflix dataset from Kaggle,
      to give you a better understanding of how I got to my analysis idea here is how the data is collected and organized: 
Show_ID- ID of the Date/TV show
type-Movie or TV show
title-Title of the movie/TV show
director-Director of the movie/TV show
Cast-actors/actress who have acted in the movie/TV show
country-Country the movie/TV show belongs to
date added-Aired dated-Released date on Netflix
release year-Original movie/TV show release date
rating-Rating of the movie/TV show
duration-Length of the movie
genre-Genre of the movie
Description-Summary of the movie
I wanted to investigate the relationship between a movie or TV show's country of origin, its genre, and its popularity and viewer ratings on the platform. This analysis will help us identify potential trends in content preferences among Netflix viewers and offer insights into the international appeal of different genres and countries' productions. Although itâ€™s a broad area of analysis I feel like its a great topic to look into since during 2021 a lot of people were stuck inside during the COVID pandemic, and this will also identify what genres were most appealing. 

    </p>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
  <p>To help clean the data and create charts, I used tools in Excel.</p>
  <p>
    My first step was data cleaning and preparation by removing any irrelevant information and making sure the numerical characters for the data were correct for my needs. I used Python in conjunction with the .CSV data set to remove any duplicated data or irrelevant data.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Code Example</h3>
  <pre>
1.	import pandas as pd
# Read the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('netflix_data.csv')
2.	# Remove rows with missing values
df = df.dropna(subset=['title', 'director', 'cast', 'country', 'date_added', 'rating', 'duration', 'genre', 'description'])

# Remove irrelevant columns if any (optional)
# df = df.drop(columns=['irrelevant_column_name'])
3.	# Convert 'date_added' to datetime
df['date_added'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_added'])

# Convert 'rating' to numeric (if it's not already)
# df['rating'] = pd.to_numeric(df['rating'])
4.	# Create a new column 'year_added' by extracting the year from 'date_added'
df['year_added'] = df['date_added'].dt.year
5.	df.to_csv('cleaned_netflix_data.csv', index=False)

  </pre>
